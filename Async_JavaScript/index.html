        <h1>Asynchronus JavaScript, Promises, and Callbacks.</h1>

        <h2>Asynchronus JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Asynchronous means that things can happen independently of the main program flow.<br /> 
        In the current consumer computers, every program runs for a specific time slot and<br />
        then it stops its execution to let another program continue their execution.</p>

        <h2>Promises</h2>
        <p>Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.<br />
        They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations<br />
        where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.</p>
        <p>Closures and Promise are different concepts. Closures refers to scope of variables<br />
        where as promise are used to 'promise' that an act on something will occur<br />
        when it is done on an asynchronous action.</p>

        <h2>Callbacks</h2>
        <p>A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.<br />
        This technique allows a function to call another function.<br />
        A callback function can run after another function has finished.</p>
