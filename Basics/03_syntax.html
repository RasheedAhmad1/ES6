        <h1>JavaScript Syntax</h1>
        <p>JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed</p>
        <h2>JavaScript Values</h2>
        <p>The JavaScript syntax difines two types of values</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed Values: Fixed values are called Literals</li>
            <li>Variable Values: Variable values are called Variables</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> JavaScript Literals</h2>
        <p>The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Numbers are written with or without decimals i.e 10.50, 1001</li>
            <li>Strings are text, written within double or single quotes i.e "Jhon Doe", 'Jhon Doe'</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>
        <p>In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.<br />
            JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.<br />
            An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.<br />
            In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6<br />
            There are different types of operators in JavaScript</p>
        <p>let x;<br />
        x = 5;</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Operators</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, an operator is a special symbol used to perform operations on operands (values and variables)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arithmetic Operators: -, +, *, /, %, ++, --</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increment: ++</li>
                    <li>Decrement: --</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=</li>
            <li>Comparison Operators</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Equal (==): Compare only the value</li>
                    <li>Strick Equal (Triple equals - ===): It is a strict equality comparison operator,<br />
                    compares the value as well as the type</li>
                    <li>Inequality (!=)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The inequality operator (!=) is the logical opposite of the equality operator. It means “Not Equal” and returns true where equality would return false and vice versa.</li>
                            <li>Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.</li>
                            <li>For example 1 != ‘1’ will return false since data type conversion take place so 1 and ‘1’ are considered equal.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Strick Inequality (!==):</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means “Strictly Not Equal” and returns true where strict equality would return false and vice versa.</li>
                            <li>Strict inequality will not convert data types.</li>
                            <li>For example 1 !== ‘1’ will return true since 1 is an integer and ‘1’ is a character and no data type conversion take place.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Less than (&lt;)</li>
                    <li>Less than and equal (&lt;=)</li>
                    <li>Greater than (>)</li>
                    <li>Greater than and equal (>=)</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Logical Operators</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>and ( && )</li>
                    <li>or ( || )</li>
                    <li>not ( ! )</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript Expressions</h2>
        <p>An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.<br />
            The computation is called an evaluation.<br />
            For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50:<br />
            5 * 10<br />
            Expressions can also contain variable values:<br />
            x * 10<br />
            The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.<br />
            For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe":<br />
            "John" + " " + "Doe"</p><br />

        <h2> JavaScript Keywords</h2>
        <p>JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.<br />
            The let keyword tells the browser to create variables:<br />
            let x, y;<br />
            x = 5 + 6;<br />
            y = x * 10;<br />
            The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables:<br />
            var x, y;<br />
            x = 5 + 6;<br />
            y = x * 10;<br />
            In these examples, using var or let will produce the same result.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>
        <p>Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".<br />
            Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.<br />
            Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:<br />
            let x = 5;   // I will be executed<br />
            // x = 6;   I will NOT be executed</p>
