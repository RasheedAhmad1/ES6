<!--* JavaScript Where To
    - In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags. 
    - Example
    <script>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
    </script> 
    * JavaScript in <head> or <body>
    - You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
    - Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
    * JavaScript in <head>
    - In the below example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <head> section of an HTML page.
    - The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked:
    - JavaScript in <body>
    - In the below example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <body> section of an HTML page.
    - The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- <script>
            function myFunction() {
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
            }
        </script> -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Demo JavaScript in Head and Body</h2>
        <p id="demo">A Paragraph</p>
        <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
        <script>
            function myFunction() {
              document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
            }
        </script>
        <!-- <script src="myScript.js"></script> --> <!-- External file -->
    </body>
</html>

<!-- * External JavaScript
- Scripts can also be placed in external files:

- External file: myScript.js

- External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

- JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

- To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:

- Example
- <script src="myScript.js"></script>
- You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.

- The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located.

- External scripts cannot contain <script> tags. -->
